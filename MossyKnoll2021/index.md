#### First trip off the mainland with the rebuilt KLX250

## Mossy Knoll Camp

It and I both arrive in a friend's van late to camp and had to sleep close to the road that night. Soon after sunrise I heard the distinct tone of the rotax engine found in the BMW F series and knew the scouts had found us. We were escorted to camp and after breakfast opted for Ladies' Spa Day at the Sol-Doc hot springs nearby. 

But before that a quick trial run up the road to Sore Thumb was in order. It was entirely managable forest road gradual climb with only a few significant pot holes and deep, loose dirt in spots. The ridge line ended in the rewarding 360 degree panorama where the path to the stone peak was not well maintained and precarious so we opted to turn back.

Spa day went well. Naturally we arrived during the busiest session of the day and had to wait until 4pm to be admitted. A little late for swimming if you ask me but who can resist hot springs?

That night we ate our grocery camp supplies including deli turkey slices on soft flour tortillas with cheese and lettuce. I found a beet-cumin spread that was a totally new taste to me. After my taste buds adjustments I decided it might need a few more ingredients to really shine.

The next morning we slept late and waiting for the rest of the campers to show up and entertained a visitor on a KTM 1090 who was just passing through. Once all campers were accounted for a spa session was hastily planned for earlier in the day and we were off again for a much better time slot. Following that we intended to finish the daylight at the shore of Lake Crescent.

By incredible coincidence the entire camp managed to converge at once on the western shore of Lake Crescent which is where we spent the Sunday afternoon. Bright sunlight combined with brisk winds made the shore overall comfortable if somewhat dramatic once the shadows grew long. I was still on my first tank of fuel and rather then risk running low I chose to return to Port Angelos, WA and top the tank off.

After running the 27 miles at 7k+ rpm on the new engine at last the source of the oil leak revealed itself during the subsequent fuel stop. I could clearly see a channel of burned and fresh oil running down the front right side of the cylinder where the cam chain travels up and slings oil. It did not seem bad but I know it was not doing that after the 150 mile break-in I had already done in the safety of the mainland. 

This turned the trip on a sour note and as the sun was setting and I had recently bid goodbye to the only hope of convenient rescue I had so I elected to return to camp straight away as the sun fell behind the trees and the air turned foggy cold. 

That night we ate more grocery store food including some creatively cooked sausages and innovativly shaped meat-substitute products. 

Late after sunrise the following day we struck camp and assessed plans to return. Before departing the forest we made a quick stop at a nearby enduro park complete with hill climbs, berms, rock pits, and more I was unable to explore because I was did not want to stress the leaking head gasket so far away. 

We finally got underway on RT 101 eastbound after dropped our trash at a nearby campground and fueling up once more in Port Angelos, WA. The head gasket leak was clearly getting worse and I was not entirely sure what to do next. The group decided to get lunch nearby and I considered renting a truck to transport the ailing bike home. Instead I chose to purchase some gas station 10w-40 oil that I knew would be bad for the clutch and other parts but figured it would be better then no oil at all for a handful of miles.

From there we made a bee-line for the Edmonds ferry and my fellow travelers were gracious and kind in their offers to stick with me until we got out of trouble. This was the only thing the set my mind at ease as I carefully worked the little engine over the terrian of the Northeastern Olympic Peninsula to the Hood Canal Bridge and finally into the ferry berth in Kingston. By then I had to add approx 1/10 of a liter of the counter-indicated oil and the clutch was all but gone. The bike also had trouble starting but otherwise managed to soldier on into the Edmond's ferry public tranportation lot where I finally brought it to a rest and called a tow truck.
